VCS and GitVersion Control SystemIs a tool designed to make it easier for one or more developers to work with a set of files.It does this by making snapshots of all the files in your project at a particular time and letting you view, compare, and restore files in different snapshots.Some of it’s main feature :Provides backups of files in case current versions are lost.Shows how a file’s contents have changed over time.Shows who made which changes to which files, and when.Labels certain file snapshots for future reference.Provides a human-readable description of each set of changes so that team members can understand why changes were made.VCS over the years :There have been many competing VCSs over the years, both open source and proprietary. Some of the best-known examples are Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, CVS, Apache Subversion, and now Git.For reasons , Git has largely taken over the VCS space and now serves as the default VCS for any team that doesn’t have a company mandate to use one of Git’s competitors. In other words, Git has won the VCS competition, to the extent that such a victory is possible.Why did Git win the competition :Pedigree : Git was invented by Linus Torvalds as a tool for storing and managing the source code for the Linux kernel. The fact that Git was originally used to store high-profile, successful, and widely adopted code such as the Linux kernel no doubt gave it instant credibility and cachet: if it’s robust and reliable enough for Linus and Linux, it’s good enough for you.Simple branch management : branches are one of the most important components of any VCS. Git was designed from the beginning to make it simple to create, use, and merge branches. The ease with which developers can work with branches encourages them to use lots of branches, which promotes safe and rapid development workflows.Speed : Git is fast. Adding new files, checking in changes, reverting to old code, and syncing files to incorporate coworkers’ edits – these operations all happen in just a few seconds, even with large projects.Reliability : it’s virtually unheard of for Git to suffer from technical glitches that result in data loss. It’s trusted by countless teams of skeptical software engineers around the world, and that trust is well-earned.Why use Git ?Git is a powerful tool for version control that is used by developers and teams to manage changes to code and other files. Here are some simple reasons why you might want to use Git:Keep track of changes: Git allows you to keep track of changes made to your code over time. This is useful when you need to go back and see what changes were made or if you need to revert to an earlier version of your code.Collaboration: Git makes it easy for teams to work together on the same codebase. It allows multiple people to make changes to the same files and merge those changes together.Branching and merging: With Git, you can create branches to work on different features or fixes independently. When you're ready, you can merge those changes back into the main codebase.Backup: Git provides a backup for your code. You can use it to store your code on a remote server or cloud-based repository so that it's safe in case of data loss.Open source: Git is open-source software, which means it's free to use and there's a large community of developers that contribute to its development. This also means that you have access to a wide range of tools and resources to help you get started with Git.How does it work ?Start a projectThere are two ways to do it , either the project exist and you clone it , or you create a folder in your computer (local )use Git clone and the ssh key of the repo ]]>Creating a local repo :Let’s use those commands to create a new repository for our Hats for Cats project. First, make a new directory that will become a repository, and move into that directory (the example in this chapter is using a Linux Terminal, so the prompt and output may look slightly different if you use another terminal or OS, but the concepts will be the same):Prove that it’s not a Git repo yet:Turn the directory into a Git repo with the git init command:Now, watch how git status doesn’t explicitly tell us that we’re in a repo, but it does provide information that only makes sense if the directory has been turned into a repository. It tells us that we’re on the main branch, that Git is not tracking any files in the repository, and that we haven’t edited any files in this directory that we may want to ask Git to manage:Git manipulationWhen adding a new file to the repo , your directory contains the file in local but Git is not tracking that file yet, since you haven’t officially added it to the repository. Doing so is a two-step process:Move one or more files into something called the staging area.Commit all the files in the staging area.It’s important to understand that a file is not stored in Git, meaning that Git will not manage the versions of that file until you stage it and then commit it.You may find it easiest to think of staging and committing as something you do to capture any changes to files, where changes can take four different forms:Creating a new fileEditing the content of an existing fileRenaming or moving a file (as far as the filesystem is concerned, these are the same operation)Deleting a filefirst create the fileNext, let’s stage your new todo.txt file using the git add command then commit the changes :A commit contains the contents of any file(s) included in that commit and a message that describes the purpose of the commit, but there are a few other pieces of information it includes as well. Here’s the complete list:Any changes made to the file’s contents (or the filename or location in the filesystem).A 40-character string of hexadecimal digits that’s called a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), which is the code that generates this string based on the contents of the committed files. A commit’s SHA uniquely identifies that commit; think of it as a unique name for that commit. SHAs are not sequential: each SHA is completely different from the SHA of the previous commit.The name and email of the person who made the commit.A timestamp of when they made the commit.A human-readable message describing why they made the commit.A pointer to the previous commit (or parent commit) on the branch. We’ll introduce the concept of branches in the next section and talk about this pointer more then.The git log command shows you all this information for all the commits on your current branch. Let’s imagine that you’ve made two commits: one to create an empty to-do list and another to add an item to that list. Running git loggives an output similar to the following: master) Author: George Spelvin Date: Tue Jan 4 09:57:37 2022 -0800 add first item to list commit 63ea581d1bc693dac159c146fa10d1cbfa4e6366 Author: George Spelvin Date: Sun Jan 2 12:31:27 2022 -0800 add list of tasks to do ]]>Excluding files from a repositoryCreate a new file called .gitignore in the root of your project’s directory. For the content of this file, add the names of any files or directories that you’d like Git to ignore. You can add explanatory comments by starting a line with a hash character.SummaryLet’s review the commands and concepts you’ve learned about in this section for keeping code safe by committing it to a Git repository:Use git init or git clone to create a Git repository on your computer.Use git add to add one or more files to Git’s staging area.Use git commit --message "" to make a new Git commit (or snapshot) that includes any files that were in the staging area.Use git status to see if you have edited files waiting to be moved to the staging area, or staged files waiting to be committed.Use git log to see information about all the commits that have been made to your current branch.Use a .gitignore file to exclude certain files or directories from the repository.Advanced Git commandsGit fetchRetrieves changes from a remote repository and stores them in the local repository, but it does not apply the changes to the local codebase. This command is useful for keeping a local repository up to date with changes made by other contributors, without incorporating those changes into your own work yet.To fetch changes from a remote repository named "origin" for the current branch:Git pullIs similar to **git fetch**but it also merges the retrieved changes into the local codebase. This command is useful when you want to incorporate changes made by others into your own work.To pull changes from a remote repository named "origin" for the current branch:Git merge**git merge**is used to combine changes from one branch into another branch. Unlike git rebase, **git merge**preserves the commit history of both branches, creating a merge commit to tie the changes together.To merge the "develop" branch into the current branch, with a commit message:git rebasegit rebase is used to incorporate changes from one branch into another branch. It rewrites the commit history of the current branch, making it appear as though the changes were made directly on top of the current branch. This can create a cleaner, more linear history.To rebase the current branch onto the "master" branch:To rebase a feature branch "feature-branch" onto the "develop" branch:| git pull | | git rebase | +-------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------+ | | v v +---------+ +---------+ | git merge|In this flowchart, git fetch retrieves changes from a remote repository and stores them locally. git pull is similar to git fetch, but also merges the changes into the current branch. git rebase incorporates changes from one branch into another and rewrites the commit history. Finally, git merge combines changes from two branches and creates a new commit to tie them together.As you can see, git pull and git rebase both involve git merge to combine changes from different branches. However, git rebase modifies the commit history while git pull simply creates a new merge commit.Git Interview questionsWhat is Git and why is it important?What is the difference between Git and other version control systems?What is a repository in Git and what is its importance?What are the different types of branching models in Git?What are the advantages of using Git for version control?What is a commit in Git and what does it consist of?What is the difference between Git pull and Git fetch?What is a merge conflict in Git and how can you resolve it?What is a Git stash and how does it work?How do you revert a commit in Git and what are the different methods to do so?How do you create a branch in Git and what is its significance?What is the difference between Git rebase and Git merge?What is a Git submodule and how does it work?What are Git hooks and how do they work?How do you collaborate with other developers using Git?More Useful links for practice and cheat sheet:https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdfhttps://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=fr_FR
