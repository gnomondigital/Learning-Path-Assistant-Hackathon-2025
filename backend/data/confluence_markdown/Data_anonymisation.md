What Is Data anonymisationData anonymization is the practice of safeguarding confidential or sensitive data by removing or encrypting identifiers that link an individual to stored data. By undergoing a data anonymization process, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, social security numbers, and addresses, can be retained while preserving the anonymity of the source. Despite the removal of identifiers, attackers may still use de-anonymization methods to trace back the anonymization process. Since data often flows through multiple sources, some of which are publicly accessible, de-anonymization techniques can cross-reference these sources to uncover personal information.The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets forth a specific set of guidelines for safeguarding user data and ensuring transparency. Although the GDPR is stringent, it allows companies to collect anonymized data without user consent, utilize it for any purpose, and store it indefinitely as long as all identifiers are removed.Data Anonymization TechniquesWith the increasing amount of data being collected and stored by organizations, ensuring the privacy and security of this data has become more critical than ever. Data anonymization is one approach that can help protect individuals' privacy and prevent sensitive information from being exposed. In this paragraph, we will explore different techniques for data anonymization, including generalization, data masking, pseudonymisation, data perturbation, data swapping, data perturbation, and synthetic data, and their respective benefits and limitations.Generalisation involves removing some data to make it less identifiable. This can be achieved by modifying the data into a set of ranges or a broad area with appropriate boundaries. For instance, the house number in an address can be removed while retaining the road name. The aim is to eliminate some of the identifiers while retaining data accuracy.Data masking refers to the technique of hiding data by altering its values through character shuffling, encryption, and substitution. This can be achieved by creating a mirrored version of a database and replacing certain characters with symbols such as “*” or “x”. The purpose of data masking is to prevent reverse engineering and detection of the original data.Pseudonymization is a method of data management and de-identification that replaces private identifiers with fake identifiers or pseudonyms. For example, the identifier “John Smith” can be replaced with “Mark Spencer”. This preserves statistical accuracy and data integrity, enabling the modified data to be used for training, development, testing, and analytics while ensuring data privacy.Data perturbation involves modifying the original dataset slightly by applying techniques that round numbers and add random noise. This technique involves using a base that is proportional to the value being modified. For example, a base of 5 can be used to round values such as age or house number while retaining their accuracy.Data swapping, also known as shuffling and permutation, is a technique used to rearrange attribute values so they don’t correspond with the original records. This technique involves swapping attributes that contain identifier values such as date of birth, which may have more impact on anonymization than membership type values.Synthetic data refers to algorithmically manufactured information that has no connection to real events. This technique involves creating statistical models based on patterns found in the original dataset and using statistical techniques such as standard deviations, medians, and linear regression to generate the synthetic data. This technique is used to create artificial datasets without risking the privacy and security of the original data.Data Anonymisation Use CasesData anonymisation has become an essential technique for protecting individual privacy and complying with privacy regulations while still being able to use data for analysis and research purposes. Here are some use cases where data anonymization is particularly useful:Healthcare: In the healthcare industry, patient data is often shared among healthcare providers for research and analysis purposes. However, this data contains sensitive information such as patient names, medical history, and diagnoses, which must be protected to comply with HIPAA regulations. By anonymizing patient data, healthcare providers can share the data without compromising patient privacy.Finance: Financial institutions collect a large amount of sensitive data from their customers, such as credit card numbers, bank account information, and transaction history. Data anonymization is critical to ensure this data is not exposed to unauthorized parties, while still allowing financial institutions to use the data for analysis and fraud detection purposes.Marketing: Marketing companies often collect personal data such as age, gender, and location to create targeted advertising campaigns. However, this data must be protected to comply with privacy regulations. By anonymizing the data, marketing companies can still use it for analysis purposes without compromising individual privacy.Research: Researchers collect vast amounts of data from various sources, including surveys, social media, and public databases. However, this data often contains personally identifiable information, which must be protected to comply with privacy regulations. By anonymizing the data, researchers can still use it for analysis purposes while safeguarding individual privacy.So what data should be anonymized in this case, what are the generale best practices attributes to protect?What Data Should Be Anonymised?Deciding which data to anonymise is a critical step in the data anonymisation process, as some data may need more protection than others to prevent the identification of individuals. Here are some general guidelines on what data should be anonymized:Personally Identifiable Information (PII): This includes information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and other data that can be used to identify individuals. PII should always be anonymized to protect individual privacy. See (SOC2 norms)Sensitive Data: This includes data that is sensitive and private, such as medical records, financial information, and personal preferences. Sensitive data should also be anonymized to prevent its unauthorized disclosure and protect individual privacy.Data with High Risk of Re-identification: Some data may not be inherently identifiable, but when combined with other information, it can reveal individuals' identities. For example, geographic data, birth dates, and occupation information, when combined, can identify an individual. Therefore, such data should also be anonymized.Data That Can Cause Harm: Any data that can cause harm to individuals if disclosed, such as data related to legal proceedings, criminal activities, or national security, should be anonymized.We should note that what constitutes sensitive data can vary depending on the individual and sector. For example, contact information may be considered impersonal to a marketing manager but highly sensitive to security personnel. Overall, there is a consensus that certain data must be anonymized to safeguard individual privacy and prevent unauthorized access.Focus GDPRThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union requires that any data stored on individuals within the EU undergo either anonymization or pseudonymization. To be exempt from GDPR requirements, data must meet the high standards set in GDPR Recital (26) and not relate to any identifiable natural person or contain personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the Spanish Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) have issued joint guidance on the requirements for anonymity and exemption from GDPR requirements, stating that no one, including the data controller, should be able to re-identify data subjects in a properly anonymized dataset. However, research by data scientists at Imperial College in London and UCLouvain in Belgium, as well as a ruling by Judge Michal Agmon-Gonen of the Tel Aviv District Court, have highlighted the limitations of anonymization in today's big data world. Anonymization is an outdated approach to data protection that was developed when data processing was limited to isolated applications prior to the widespread sharing and combining of data through "big data" processing.Exemples of Data anonymization architectureBuild a pseudonymization service on AWS to protect sensitive data, part 1Anonymize and manage data in your data lake with Amazon Athena and AWS Lake FormationIntroducing PII data identification and handling using AWS Glue DataBrewEuropean Data Act
