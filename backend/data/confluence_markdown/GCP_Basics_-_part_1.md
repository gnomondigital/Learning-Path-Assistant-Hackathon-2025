Table of content:16falsenonelisttrueIntroduction to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ServicesGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) Services is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that enables organisations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services on the cloud.GCP offers a range of services including computing, storage, and data analysis, making it an attractive option for organisations.Checkout the GCP cheat sheet :Google Cloud Developer Cheat SheetExploring Cloud Storage SolutionsGoogle Cloud Storage (GCS) is a cloud-based storage solution offered by Google. Here's a simple explanation:Provides service for storing unstructured data. Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.Storage class affects the objectâ€™s availability and pricing modelStandard Storage is best for data that is frequently accessed (hot data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time.Near line Storage is a low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data (warm data)Cold line Storage provides a very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data (cold data)Archive Storage is the lowest-cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery. (coldest data)Safe and secureObject Versioning prevents accidental overwrites and deletion. It retains a not current object version when the live object version gets replaced, overwritten or deletedParallel composite uploads divides a file into up to 32 chunks, which are uploaded in parallel to temporary objects, the final object is recreated using the temporary objects, and the temporary objects are deletedAccess Control: GCS provides fine-grained access control for data.Compute EngineGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) is a cloud computing service, here are some key points :Virtual Machines: GCE allows you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud.Scalability: GCE makes it easy to scale your computing resources up or down as needed.Customisation: GCE allows you to customise your VMs to meet your specific needs, including choosing the operating system, CPU and memory resources, and storage options.Integration: GCE integrates seamlessly with other Google Cloud services, making it easy to build, deploy, and manage your applications and services in the cloud.Deploying Applications on App EngineGoogle App Engine (GAE) is a cloud platform for building and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Here are some key points about GAE:Platform as a Service ( PaaS ): it provides everything you need to build, run, and scale your web applications, without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.Scalability: handle increased traffic and demand, making it ideal for rapidly growing web applications.Supports multiple programming languagesBigQueryGoogle BigQuery is a cloud data warehouse provided by Google Cloud Platform. Here are some key points about BigQuery:Fast Performance: provides fast query performance, allowing you to analyze large amounts of data in real-time.Big Data Analytics: designed to handle large amounts of data, making it ideal for big data analytics and business intelligence.Scalability: BigQuery can scale to handle even the largest data sets, making it ideal for growing businesses.Using Kubernetes EngineWhy use Kubernetes ?Imagine you have a bunch of toys and you want to play with them, but you don't want them all mixed up. You might put them in different baskets, or have a special place for each one.Kubernetes does the same thing for your applications. It makes sure each part has its own "basket" or "space" to run in. This makes it easier to manage and organise your applications, and helps make sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.Here are some key points about GKE:Container Management: GKE helps manage containers, which are lightweight units of software that can be easily moved from one place to another.Scalability: GKE makes it easy to scale your applications, by adding or removing containers as needed.Automated Deployment: GKE automates the deployment and management of your applications, making it easier to deploy new features and updates.GKE (google Kubernetes engine) and Kubernetes (open source):GKE provides a managed environment for running Kubernetes, while Kubernetes is a self-managed platform. with GKE, Google manages the underlying infrastructure, while with Kubernetes, you are responsible for managing the infrastructure yourself.Udemyhttps://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/learning/?q=gcp
