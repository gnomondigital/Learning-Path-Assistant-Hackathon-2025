What is BigQuery ?A Database : it allows you to store data, big quantities of data terabytes.A cloud data warehouse : a system that allows you to not only collect structured data from multiple sources but also analyze it. So it’s also called analytics databaseA columnar database: there are two ways to access data either by rows or columns , bigQuery store tables by columns so you can access all the rows of a specific column.

Each record is composed of columns (also called fields).Every table is defined by a schema that describes the column names, data types, and other information. You can specify the schema of a table when it is created, or you can create a table without a schema and declare the schema in the query job or load job that first populates it with data.BigQuery table types :Standard tablesTable clones : A table clone is a lightweight, writeable copy of another table (called the base table). You are only charged for storage of data in the table clone that differs from the base table, so initially there is no storage cost for a table clone.Table snapshots: preserves the contents of a table (called the base table) at a particular time. You can save a snapshot of a current table, or create a snapshot of a table as it was at any time in the past seven days. A table snapshot can have an expiration; when the configured amount of time has passed since the table snapshot was created, BigQuery deletes the table snapshot. Think of it as a picture in a particular time.Materialised views: are precomputed views that periodically cache the results of a query for increased performance and efficiency. BigQuery leverages precomputed results from materialized views and whenever possible reads only delta changes from the base tables to compute up-to-date results.There are some limitations with BigQuery tables:Table names must be unique per dataset.The Google Cloud console supports copying only one table at a time.When you copy tables, the destination dataset must reside in the same location as the table being copied. For example, you cannot copy a table from an EU-based dataset to a US-based dataset.When you copy multiple source tables to a destination table by using the bq command-line tool, the API, or the client libraries, all source tables must have identical schemas.When you export table data, the only supported destination is Cloud Storage.When you use an API call, enumeration performance slows as you approach 50,000 tables in a dataset.The Google Cloud console can display up to 50,000 tables for each dataset.Basic manipulations with bigQuery :create a tableYou just need to click on your project and choose add table , once the table created you can edit it to add columns or rename the existing ones, you can also add data with queriesCreate a viewThe first icon is for tables and the second one is for viewsClick on query then save view, don’t forget the project where to save itnext , let’s let’s discover more advanced manipulations with BigQuery For more readingBigQuery Tutorial For Beginners and Newbies | Coupler.io Blog
