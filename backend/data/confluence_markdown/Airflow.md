 Table of contents :IntroductionWhat is Apache Airflow?It was initially created by engineers at Airbnb in 2014 as a solution to manage the increasing complexity of data processing workflows within the company. The engineers found that existing workflow management tools were not flexible enough to handle the needs of their data processing infrastructure, which was rapidly growing and becoming more complex.The Airbnb team developed Airflow as an internal project, with the goal of providing a platform for defining, scheduling, and monitoring data processing workflows.Airbnb released Airflow as an open-source project in 2015, and it quickly gained popularity within the data engineering community.The project was contributed to the Apache Software Foundation in 2016, where it became an Apache Incubator project.After successfully completing the incubation process, Airflow became a top-level Apache project in 2019.  It was built using modern technologies such as Python, Flask, and Celery.Architecture and key componentsThe architecture of Apache Airflow is based on a distributed system of components that work together to execute workflows. The key components of Airflow are:Scheduler:The scheduler is responsible for determining when to execute each task in a workflow based on the dependencies defined between tasks.It queries the metadata database to determine which tasks are ready to be executed, and sends instructions to the executor to run the tasks.Executor:The executor is responsible for running the tasks defined in the workflow.Airflow supports several types of executors (LocalExecutor, SequentialExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and Kubernetes Executor).Each executor has its own characteristics and is designed for different use cases.Workers:Workers are the computing resources that actually execute the tasks.Airflow supports several types of workers, including Celery workers and Kubernetes pods.Workers can be scaled up or down depending on the workload.Metadata Database:Airflow uses a metadata database to store information about DAGs, tasks, and their dependencies.The metadata database is also used to track the status of tasks and workflows, as well as to store logs and other metadata.Web Server:The web server provides a user interface for interacting with Airflow, including viewing and monitoring workflows, configuring DAGs and tasks, and managing Airflow components.The web server communicates with the metadata database and the scheduler to display the current status of workflows.How the components work together to run workflowsIn Apache Airflow, the main components work together to run workflows in the following way:  DAG Directed Acyclic Graph : s a way to represent a workflow as a graph, where each node represents a task, and the edges between nodes represent the dependencies between tasks.The user defines a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which represents the workflow, using Python code.The DAG is processed by the Airflow scheduler, which determines the order in which tasks should be executed based on their dependencies and other parameters.The scheduler communicates with the Airflow database, which stores metadata about the DAG and its tasks, to track the progress of the workflow and update its status.When a task is ready to be executed, the scheduler sends a message to the executor to launch the task.The executor communicates with one or more workers to execute the task. The worker(s) may be located on the same machine as the executor or on a separate machine in a distributed computing environment.The worker executes the task and returns the result to the executor.The executor updates the status of the task in the Airflow database and waits for the next task to be ready.Steps 4-7 are repeated until all tasks in the DAG have been executed.Overall, this process enables users to define and execute complex workflows in a scalable and reliable way, with each component playing a critical role in ensuring the successful execution of the workflow.How does it workUse cases of using AirflowAirflow works with batch pipelines which are sequences of finite jobs, with clear start and end, launched at certain intervals or by triggers. The most common applications of the platform are :Data processing and ETL: it is ideal for managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and other data processing workflows, where data needs to be extracted from various sources, transformed into a usable format, and loaded into a target database or data warehouse.Machine learning and data science: Airflow can be used to manage machine learning workflows, including model training, data preparation, and model deployment.DevOps and infrastructure: Airflow can be used to manage DevOps workflows, including code deployment, database updates, and server provisioning.Marketing automation: Airflow can be used to manage marketing automation workflows, including email campaigns, social media posts, and A/B testing.Airflow active users :Benefits of using AirflowProvides a web-based user interface for monitoring workflows, with detailed logs, visualisations, and dashboards.Handles workflows of any size and complexity, thanks to its distributed architecture and ability to scale up or down based on workload.Provides a robust framework for managing workflows, with built-in error handling, retry logic, and alerting capabilities.When not to use AirflowSimple workflows:If you have a very simple workflow that can be managed with a single script or tool, Airflow may be overkill.Real-time processing:Airflow is not designed for real-time processing, as it relies on a scheduler that runs periodically (typically every minute).If you need to process data in real-time or near real-time, other tools like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink may be a better choice.Tight integration with other tools:While Airflow has many integrations with other tools and platforms, it may not support every tool or platform that you need to work with.Best practicesUse clear and descriptive names for your DAGs and tasksBreak up complex workflows into smaller, more manageable tasksUse version control for your DAGsUse environment variables or configuration files for sensitive informationUse the Airflow web UI to monitor and troubleshoot workflowsTest your workflows thoroughly before deploying themMoreBest practices:Apache Airflow Best Practices - Part 1More information :The Good and the Bad of Apache Airflow Pipeline OrchestrationUse case example :Kids First Airflow â€” Kids First Airflow documentationDive in and practice
