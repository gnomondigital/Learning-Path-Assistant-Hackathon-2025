What is dbt ?A Database Technology (DBT) tool is a software application used to create and manage databases. It includes a database management system (DBMS) to store, access, and modify data stored in a database, and SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate the data. Data engineers use DBT tools to build reliable, secure, and efficient data processing systems.dbt is the T in ELT. It doesn’t extract or load data, but it’s extremely good at transforming data that’s already loaded into your warehouse.Terms to knowTable : a table is the direct storage of data in rows and columns. Think excel sheet with raw values in each of the cells.or views. The main DML statements are SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.A view (as opposed to a table) is a defined passthrough SQL query that can be run against a database (or data warehouse). A view doesn’t store data, like a table does, but it defines the logic that you need to fetch the underlying data.DML : Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a class of SQL statements that are used to query, edit, add and delete row-level data from database tablesDDL : powerful and irreversible commands with potential high-riskData Definition Language is a group of SQL statements that you can execute to manage database objects, including tables, views, and more. Using DDL statements, you can perform powerful commands in your database such as creating, modifying, and dropping objects. DDL commands are usually executed in a SQL browser or stored procedure.Example of commands: Alter, Drop, Create, Truncate( delete all data but leaves the structure)…Package:In dbt libraries are called packages and it consisted of software engineer frequently modularize code so to not repeat something already done.These packages are powerful because it contained solutions to many analytics problemsHow to add a package to the dbt project?Add package.yml to your project in the same level as dbt_project.ymlSpecify the package you want to add(Here we see the three methods of adding a package : hub, git or local see more about it https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages )Run dbt deps to install the packagesDbt clean to delete all packages followed by dbt depsJinja:a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax.Something simplerJinja means temple in japan witch close to templateUsing Jinja turns your dbt project into a programming environment for SQL, giving you the ability to do things that aren't normally possible in SQL. For example, with Jinja you can:Use control structures (e.g. if statements and for loops) in SQLUse environment variables in your dbt project for production deploymentsChange the way your project builds based on the current target.Operate on the results of one query to generate another query, for example:Return a list of payment methods, in order to create a subtotal column per payment method (pivot)Return a list of columns in two relations, and select them in the same order to make it easier to union them togetherAbstract snippets of SQL into reusable macros— these are analogous to functions in most programming languages.In fact, if you've used the{{ ref() }} function, you're already using Jinja!So jinja + sql = better code and resultsMacros:pieces of code that can be reused multiple times – they are analogous to "functions" in other programming languages, and are extremely useful if you find yourself repeating code across multiple models. Macros are defined in .sql files, typically in your macros directoryBy default dbt will search for macros in the directory named macrosLike any language we have a library of functions, in this situation we have a package of macros, and the most popular ones are in dbt-utilsHooks :They are snippets (blocks) of sql that are executed at different timesModel: a data transformation, expressed in a single SELECT statement.Every model is exactly one SELECT query.Materialization: the strategy by which a data model is built in the warehouse. Models are materialized into views and tables, but there are a large number of possible refinements, including incrementally-loaded tables, date-partitioned tables, and more.DRY : don’t repeat yourself a software development principle that stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” Living by this principle means that your aim is to reduce repetitive patterns and duplicate code and logic.WET : which stands for “Write Everything Twice” , is considered a bad habitHow do you use dbtsimply put we use dbt as a tool to pull raw data from a warehouse next make all transformations by writing sql commands ( select ) .This sql code is then stored in git ( you can link dbt to your repository ), or you can create tables or views and save them in the data warehouse that you are using.there are two dbt products :dbt core ( pen-source tool that enables data teams to transform data using analytics engineering best practices), a command line solution.dbt cloud (fastest and most reliable way to deploy dbt. Develop, test, schedule, and investigate data models all in one web-based UI): a web solution.Why use dbt :Build reusable data models instead of starting from the raw data every time : your sql code is saved so you can reuse it as many times as you needNot repeating code by using macros, hooks, package management.It’s linked to all the cloud solutions, it makes work flow more smooth.QuestionsWhat is the position of dbt in data engineeringWill it be a permanent toolHow to integrate the tool to the processUseful linksWhat is dbt? | dbt Developer HubWhat, exactly, is dbt?A Beginner's Guide to DBT (data build tool) - Part 1: IntroductionSign In to O'Reilly
