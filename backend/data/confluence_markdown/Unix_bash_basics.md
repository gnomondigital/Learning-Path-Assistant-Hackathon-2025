Table of content:noneHistory of UnixUnix originated from the Multics project in 1969, spearheaded by AT&T’s Bell Labs researchers Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Designed as a multi-user, time-sharing system, Unix introduced core concepts that became fundamental to modern operating systems. The Unix philosophy emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and reusability of software components.Unix ArchitectureUnix systems are built around a core kernel that manages hardware and system processes. The user interacts with the system through a shell, a command-line interface that interprets and executes commands.Key Components:Kernel: The core of the operating system, managing hardware, processes, and system resources.Shell: The interface between the user and the kernel, interpreting commands and scripts.Navigating the Unix File SystemBasic Commands:Here is a list of essential Unix commands:pwd: Prints the current working directory. This helps you see where you are in the file system.ls: Lists the contents of a directory. You can use various options with ls to display detailed information (e.g., ls -l for a long listing format).cd: Changes the current directory. For example, cd /home/john navigates to the /home/john directory.mkdir: Creates a new directory. For instance, mkdir new_folder creates a directory named new_folder.rmdir: Removes an empty directory. Use rm -r to remove directories and their contents recursively.Path Navigation:Absolute Paths: Specify the complete path from the root directory. For example, /usr/local/bin is an absolute path.Relative Paths: Specify the path relative to the current working directory. For example, ../docs refers to the docs directory one level up from the current directory.Special Symbols:.: Refers to the current directory...: Refers to the parent directory.~: Represents the home directory of the current user.Navigating the Unix file system effectively involves understanding the structure, using commands efficiently, and managing permissions. Mastering these aspects will enhance your productivity and control over the Unix environment.Understanding Unix PermissionsUnix permissions are based on a simple model that divides users into three categories and grants permissions for three types of operations. Here’s a breakdown of the concepts:User CategoriesOwner: The user who owns the file or directory. The owner is typically the user who created the file.Group: A set of users who share access to the file or directory. Each file or directory is associated with a group, and permissions can be set specifically for this group.Others: All other users on the system who are neither the owner nor part of the group associated with the file.Permission TypesRead (r): Allows the user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.Write (w): Allows the user to modify or delete the file or add/remove files in a directory.Execute (x): Allows the user to execute a file (if it is a program or script) or access a directory and its subdirectories.Each character in this string represents a specific permission:File Type: The first character indicates the type of the file:- for a regular filed for a directoryl for a symbolic linkOther types include c for character devices, b for block devices, etc.Owner Permissions: The next three characters represent the permissions for the owner of the file.rwx means the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.Group Permissions: The following three characters show the permissions for the group.r-x means the group has read and execute permissions but not write.Others Permissions: The last three characters indicate the permissions for others.r-- means others have read-only permissions.Viewing PermissionsYou can view file and directory permissions using the ls -l command. Here’s an example of its output:Changing PermissionsPermissions can be modified using the chmod command. There are two ways to specify permissions: symbolic and numeric.Symbolic ModeIn symbolic mode, permissions are represented by letters, and changes are made using symbols:Add permissions: +Remove permissions: -Set specific permissions: =Examples:chmod u+x file.txt adds execute permission for the owner (user).chmod g-w file.txt removes write permission from the group.chmod o=r file.txt sets read-only permissions for others.Numeric ModeIn numeric mode, permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number:Read: 4Write: 2Execute: 1Permissions are set by summing these values:7 (4+2+1): Read, write, and execute6 (4+2): Read and write5 (4+1): Read and execute4 (4): Read onlyExamples:chmod 755 file.txt sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x (read, write, and execute for owner; read and execute for group and others).chmod 644 file.txt sets permissions to rw-r--r-- (read and write for owner; read-only for group and others).Changing OwnershipFile and directory ownership can be changed using the chown command:Examples:chown user:group file.txt changes the owner to user and the group to group.chown user file.txt changes only the owner, leaving the group unchanged.Special PermissionsUnix systems also support special permissions:Setuid (Set User ID):When applied to an executable file, the program runs with the privileges of the file’s owner.Indicated by an s in the owner’s execute position (e.g., -rwsr-xr-x).Setgid (Set Group ID):When applied to a directory, new files and directories created within inherit the group of the directory, not the user’s default group.Indicated by an s in the group’s execute position (e.g., -rwxr-sr-x).When applied to an executable file, the program runs with the privileges of the file’s group.Sticky Bit:When applied to a directory, only the file’s owner can delete or rename files within that directory.Indicated by a t in the others’ execute position (e.g., drwxrwxrwt).Unix permissions are a powerful way to control access to files and directories, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. By understanding and using permission commands, you can manage access effectively and maintain system security.Command Line Redirection and PipingRedirection and piping allow you to control the flow of input and output in Unix.RedirectionOutput Redirection: Redirect output to a file. file]]>Append Output: Append output to a file.> file]]>Input Redirection: Use a file as input.PipingPipe: Use the output of one command as the input to another.Hands-On Examples in PythonLet’s create a Python script and use Unix commands to manage and execute it.Step 1: Create a Python ScriptCreate a file named hello.py with the following content:Step 2: Execute the ScriptMake the script executable and run it:Step 3: Redirect OutputRedirect the output of the script to a file: output.txt # View the content of the file cat output.txt]]>Step 4: Use a PipeUse the output of the script as input to another command:ConclusionThis guide provided an introduction to Unix, covering its history, architecture, basic commands, permissions, and command line techniques. By following the hands-on examples, you gained practical experience in using Unix commands and managing Python scripts. For more information, refer to the official Unix documentation.
