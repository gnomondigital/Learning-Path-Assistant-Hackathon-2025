Flask / Fast APIWhat is an APIWhat is it ?An API, or Application Programming Interface is a way of two systems to talk with each other and exchange informations.Allows different applications to communicate and share data with each otherEnables automation of tasks and processesAllows for data analysis and machine learning What does the provider gain ?API providers may charge for access to their data or for a certain number of API calls, thus they can monetise their data.History of APIsSome free APIsIt exists complete free APIs that you can use for your projects like : Weather APIs, Social Media APIs, News APIs, Maps and Location APIs, Translation APIs … Ten how do they gain from this ?Increase visibility and brand awareness, which leads to increased usage, customer loyalty, and ultimately more revenue.Gain insights into how their data is being used and which parts of their data are most valuable.New partnerships and business opportunities. Types of APIsThere are as much types as there are purpose for creating an API, here are somme of them :Open APIs: these are free ones, used to share general informations (weather ….)Internal (private) APIs: used only inside the company for sensitive informations : inventory …Partner APIs: Used the share informations with specific partners.Composite APIs: these allow you to access multiple endpoints in one request. It helps reduce the number of requests endpoints : a specific location or address that an API uses to receive requests and send responses.Different endpoints → different results.ex:api.weather.com/v1/forecast - This endpoint could be used to retrieve the forecast for a specific location.api.weather.com/v1/current - This endpoint could be used to retrieve the current weather conditions for a specific location. Web APIs: Use the internet to share information. with http protocolLibrary APIs: built into software libraries , like an api to adjust the size of an image in a library for image processingDatabase APIs: let programmers interact with database…. and many moreAPI Key and AuthenticationNow that we know what is an API, can we write a python code and have access to free data using it  ?Yes , you can BUT you need to know that even free APIs needs a form of authentication like an API key, to get it you have to register on the API provider's website, and create an account. Once you have an account, you can usually find your API key in the account settings or developer portal. and you’re good to go.Other ways of Authentication:When accessing an API, some endpoints may require authentication, which means that you need to provide a valid username and password, or API key, in order to access the data.here are the different types of authentication methods:Basic Authentication : you need to provide a username and password to access the API. The username and password are encoded in base64 and passed in the headers of the request.OAuth : Open Authorisation allows the user to grant permission to a third-party application to access the user's data without sharing their credentials. ex: you tell google to share your data with a game app , without giving your passwordtoken-based authentication : the user exchanges their credentials for a token, which is then passed with each subsequent request to the API. This token is usually a long random string, and it is associated with the user's session.API Endpoints and Methodsan API endpoint is like a door to a room. It's a way for other people (or computers) to access the information or tools that are inside that room. Endpoints are identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator), a string of characters that describe the location of the endpoint, ex: "**https://www.example.com/api/users**"API methods (verbs), are the actions that you can perform on an endpoint. The most common are: In summary , an API endpoint is the road to reach the destination and the methods are the actions that you take once you get there.API protocolsAPI protocols are the set of rules and conventions that govern how different systems interact with each other over a network. There are several different API protocols in use today, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Notes :API are created by it’s provider, and they are like doors to the data of the providerTo access you need authentication and authorisation (you may have access to get but not post)The process: you send your request to the API → it verifies your credentials/ keys then if you have the authorisation → if yes then it collects the data and sends it to youthe most used is REST API but GraphQL is catching upTo practise you can use : Django, Flask, Fast APIRemember the four : post (to write), get (to read), delete (hardly used) , put (update existing data)Learn to understand the API response and meanings : 2xx → everything is good , 3XX → redirection (proxy), 4XX → problems in client side, 5XX → problems with the APIHTTP response status codes - HTTP | MDNFast APIinstall fast API and uvicorn (minimal low-level server/application interface for async frameworks.) FastAPI is a Python class that provides all the functionality for your API.to create the main.py follow the steps :import FastAPI from fastapicreate a fast api instance : app = FastAPI. the app will be called with uvicorncreate a path operation also called endpoint or route :https://exemple.com/ the start of endpoints like /items/foofor each endpoint you can apply the following methods also called operations : GET, PUT, DELETE, POST and the more exotic ones : OPTIONS, HEAD, PATCH, TRACEpath operation decorator: consists of a function and a decorator in the form @something above it. ex: @something.operation(”path”)Source :https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/application-programming-interface/
