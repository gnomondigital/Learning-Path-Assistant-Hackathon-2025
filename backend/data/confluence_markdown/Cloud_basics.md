Table of contentnoneCloud : historyCloud computing is a way to store, access and manage data and applications over the internet, instead of having them on your own personal computer or in your own physical server. It allows for greater flexibility and scalability in terms of storage and computing power, as well as cost savings by only paying for what you use.Additionally, it allows for easy access to your files and applications from any device with internet access. This technology enables businesses and individuals to access a shared pool of configurable computing resources on-demand, such as storage, networks, servers, applications and services over the internet.it was in 2006 that Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced its first cloud computing services, that the cloud computing industry began to take shape in a more recognizable form.AWS is considered the first true cloud computing platform, and it offered a range of services such as :storage, computing power, and databases, that could be accessed and paid for on a pay-as-you-go basis.This made cloud computing more accessible and affordable for businesses of all sizes, and marked the beginning of the widespread adoption of cloud computing that we see today.Types of CloudPrivate clouds : you can rent different types of computer resources, like storage space and processing power, from a big company over the internet, and you can use them whenever you want.Public clouds : you can rent computer resources, like storage space and processing power, from a big company, but only you and your company can use them.Hybrid clouds : you can use a mix of public and private cloud, keeping some resources in-house and some in the cloud.This allows you to have more control over sensitive data, while still being able to take advantage of the cost savings and scalability of the public cloud.Multiclouds : where an organisation uses multiple cloud services from different providers. This can include using a combination of public and private clouds, as well as different providers for different services.Why do that ?Take advantage of the best features and services offered by different providersAvoid vendor lock-in, which is when an organization becomes dependent on a single provider for all of its services Types of Cloud ServicesInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This is like renting a big Lego set. You can build whatever you want with it, but you have to put it together yourself.With IaaS, you rent the basic building blocks of a computer, like storage space and processing power, and then you can use them to build your own website or application.Platform as a Service (PaaS): This is like renting a play-set that is already built. You don't have to build it yourself, but you can still play with it and add your own figures or decorations.With PaaS, you rent a platform, like a website or application, that is already built, and you can add your own code or content to it.Software as a Service (SaaS): This is like renting a video game to play. With SaaS, you rent a software application, like an email or calendar program, that is already built and ready to use.With Saas you don't have to build it yourself, you just have to pay to use it.Concerning on-peremises it’s another type of cloud computing , the company owns the data centers and has it’s own cloud .Most companies use on-permesis to secure it’s data (public services, banks, investments companies) then add another cloud service for other services .On-premises systems are also referred to as "on-prem" or "on-premise" systems. What can you rent ?Storage : object storage, block storage, and file storage that can be used to store and manage data.Computing power : virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions that can be used to run applications and perform tasks.Data analytics : resources such as big data processing, machine learning, and data visualisation services that can be used to analyze and gain insights from data…Databases : This includes resources such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data warehousing services that can be used to store and manage data.Object storage: Objects consist of a file and metadata, which describes the file. it is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data: images, videos, and backups.Block storage: store data that requires low-latency (the delay between the command and the result is negligible/smooth ) access, such as databases or virtual machines.File storage: stores data in a hierarchical file system, similar to the way data is stored on a traditional hard drive. Like documents, spreadsheets, and images.Cloud ProvidersThey are companies that rent out computer resources, like storage and processing power, over the internet. These resources can be used to build and run websites, apps, and other things.Amazon Web Services (AWS)Launched in 2006 , and now it became the largest cloud provider in the wore.provides a wide range of cloud computing services, including storage, computing power, databases, analytics, and moreIt offers a pay-as-you-go pricing modelOffers a free tier for some services, which allows you to try them out before committing to a paid plan.Microsoft AzureFirst announced in 2008 and became generally available in 2010created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying and managing applications and services.Azure offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, similar to AWS, with different pricing options.offers a free tier, that allows you to try some services before committing to a paid plan.Google Cloud Platform (GCP)First announced in 2011 and has since grown to become one of the largest cloud providers in the world.It is a collection of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products.Offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, with different pricing options.Offers a free tier, that allows you to try some services before committing to a paid plan.
