Dbt cloud IDEGit controlsAll git commands in the IDE are completed here.This will change dynamically based on the git status of your project.File treeThis is the main view into your dbt project.This is where a dbt project is built in the form of .sql, .yml, and other file types.Preview / Compile SQLThese two buttons apply to statements and SQL files.Preview will compile and run your query against the data warehouse. The results will be displayed in the "Query Results" tab along the bottom of your screen.Compile SQL will compile any Jinja into pure SQL. This will be displayed in the Info Window in the "Compiled SQL" tab along the bottom of your screen.Info windowThis window will show results when you click on Preview or Compile SQL.This is helpful for troubleshooting errors during development.The "Lineage" will also show a diagram of the model that is currently open in the text editor and its ancestors and dependencies.Command lineThis is where you can execute specific dbt commands (e.g. dbt run, dbt test).This will pop up to show the results as they are processed. Logs can also be viewed here.View docsThis button will display the documentation for your dbt project.More details on this in the documentation module.Naming convention :Source : raw dataStaging (stg) : built 1_1 relation with the source and These are used for very light transformations that shape the data into what you want it to be.Intermediate (int) : tables that exists between staging and the final tablesFact (fct) : things that occurs over time : clicks , events …Dimension (dim) : things that exists : entity a person, place or thing like customers , products …dbt commands :dbt runWhen dbt run is executed, dbt will automatically run every model in the models directory. When dbt run command is used the files are run from left to right (the scheme in lineage ) It is the execution of the Select statements in the sql files , you can either create tables or views If that model already exists in the data warehouse, dbt will automatically drop that table or view before building the new database object.If you are on BigQuery, you may need to run dbt run --full-refresh for this to take effect.How to specify table or view ?Automatically dbt will generate a view if you want a table you have two options:Change the specification in the yml file from view to tableAdd to your sql file a jinja code to indicate the you want a tableHow to specify the execution of a folder ?dbt run -s staging will run all models that exist in models/staging So the organization of your files in different folders is very importantHere is an example of organisationdbt testWith have two type of test :Generic tests : written in iml fileSingular tests : written against the modal witch means with the sql codeThe execution of dbt test runs all tests in the dbt project Here are the commands to specify the type or the modal where to run tests:dbt test --select test_type:genericdbt test --select test_type:singulardbt test --select one_specific_modelThe traditional tests that we run are : unique, not_null, accepted_values , relationship…dbt Cloud will provide a visual for your test results. Each test produces a log that you can view to investigate the test results further.dbt docs generateThis command generates the documentation for your projectwhere does the information come from ?The doc input is from the description written in the yml file The description of a model, a table or a column .all this information will be used to generate the documentation so don’t hesitate to write, in the long run it’ll be worth it.You can also add an external description by creating an md file with jinja contentThen you just have to call it in the yml fileAnd you’re good to go .Good to have : dbt fundamentals certificationLearn Analytics Engineering with dbt | dbt Learn
