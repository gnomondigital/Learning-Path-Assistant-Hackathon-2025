Table of content:noneIntroductionIn today’s fast-paced software development landscape, the need for quicker delivery and more reliable software has never been more critical. DevOps, a combination of “development” and “operations,” has emerged as a solution to bridge the gap between these two traditionally siloed areas. By fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, DevOps enables organisations to deliver software more efficiently and reliably.Before the advent of DevOps, the process of delivering software was often slow and error-prone. The development team would write and test code, but then had to wait for the operations team to deploy it. This could take weeks or even months, depending on the complexity of the infrastructure and the workload of the operations team. The lack of collaboration between development and operations often led to miscommunications, delays, and software that did not meet the end-users’ needs.DevOps is a way of working that helps organisations build and deliver software faster and more reliably. It brings together the development team, which writes and tests code, and the operations team, which deploys and maintains the software. By adopting DevOps practices, organisations can release new features and updates more quickly and respond more swiftly to changing business needs.DevOps uses tools and practices like continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), monitoring, and configuration management to automate tasks and improve efficiency. These practices help in reducing human error, ensuring consistency, and speeding up the deployment process.Practices that DevOps introducedDevelopment: In this step, the development team writes and tests code for an application. This might include writing new features, fixing bugs, or making changes to existing code.Version control: After the code is written, it is saved to a special place called a "repository." This repository is like a library that stores all the different versions of the code. This is useful because it allows the developers to keep track of the changes they make to the code, and it also makes it easy for them to work together on the same codebase.Continuous integration: The next step is to automatically check that the code is working correctly. This is called "continuous integration," or CI. The CI process runs a series of tests on the code to make sure it is working as intended. If the tests pass, it means the code is ready to be deployed.Deployment: After the code has passed the CI tests, it is ready to be deployed to production. This means that it is sent to a special place where it can be used by real people.Monitoring: Once the code is deployed, the operations team needs to keep an eye on it to make sure it is working correctly. They do this by using tools to monitor the performance of the application and its infrastructure. If they see any problems, they can fix them right away.In general, DevOps is described as a cycle of practices: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, and monitor.Tools that DevOps introducedGit: Git is a tool that helps developers to keep track of the changes they make to their code. It is like a special library that stores all the different versions of the code, so that the developers can go back and see what they did at any time.Jenkins: Jenkins is a tool that helps with something called "continuous integration," or CI. CI is a process that automatically checks that the code is working correctly. Jenkins runs a series of tests on the code to make sure it is working as intended, and it can also automatically deploy the code to production if the tests pass.Ansible: Ansible is a tool that helps with something called "configuration management." This means that it helps the operations team to keep track of all the different parts of an application's infrastructure and make sure they are set up and working correctly. Ansible can automate tasks like setting up servers and installing software, which saves the operations team a lot of time.Nagios: Nagios is a tool that helps the operations team to monitor the performance of an application and its infrastructure. It can send alerts if there are any problems, so that the operations team can fix them right away.ELK stack: The ELK stack is a group of tools that help the operations team to collect and store logs from an application. Logs are records of what is happening within an application, and they can be useful for troubleshooting problems and understanding how the application is being used. The ELK stack consists of three tools:LogStash is a tool that collects log data from different sources and sends it to ElasticSearch.ElasticSearch is a tool that stores and searches through log data.Kibana is a tool that provides a user-friendly interface for searching and visualizing log data stored in ElasticSearch.Docker: Docker is a tool that helps the operations team to package applications in a way that makes it easy to deploy and run them. Applications can be complex, with many different parts that need to be installed and configured. Docker makes it easy to package all of these parts into a single "container" that can be easily deployed and run on any infrastructure.ConclusionDevOps represents a cultural shift in how organisations build, deliver, and maintain software. By fostering collaboration between development and operations teams and leveraging automation tools, DevOps enables faster, more reliable software delivery. The practices and tools introduced by DevOps have revolutionised the software development lifecycle, making it more efficient and responsive to business needs.This enhanced article provides a more comprehensive overview of DevOps, its practices, and tools, helping readers understand the transformation it brings to software development and delivery.More materialshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB0nUzAI7M8Then read the following :https://faun.pub/what-is-ci-cd-pipeline-in-devops-6fba17a76e73
