This hands-on guide will walk you through practical steps to get started with Docker, including creating a Dockerfile, building an image, and running a container.Why use Docker ?let’s say you created an application on your personal computer, and it works completely fine in your machine.You want to give it to someone else to use it or to the production team in your companybut it doesn’t work !What is the issue ? most of the reasons could be :DependenciesLibraries and versionsFrameworkMicroservices …In this situation what’s the solution?It would be helpful if we could export all the environment in which the application works.But we can do that, we can store the application and it’s dependancies in a container and ship it to everyone , after that you just need to run it.so it will always run the same regardless of the environment.This is where Docker is used , it packages an application and all it’s dependencies an a virtual container that rans on any linux server.Getting Started with DockerInstalling DockerFirst, you need to install Docker. Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system:Windows: Install Docker Desktop on WindowsMac: Install Docker Desktop on MacLinux: Install Docker Engine on LinuxSetting Up Your First Docker ProjectCreate a Project DirectoryCreate a file named app.py with the following content:Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions to build a Docker image. Create a file named Dockerfile with the following content:Open your terminal in the project directory and run:This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile and tags it as my-docker-python-app.After building the image, run a container using the following command:This command maps port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to see your application running.Docker notionsUnderstanding Docker Images and ContainersDocker Image: A read-only template that includes your application and its dependencies.Docker Container: A runtime instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring consistent environments.Docker RegistryDocker Hub: A public registry where you can store and share Docker images. Create an account at Docker Hub and log in via the terminal:Docker ComposeDocker Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Create a docker-compose.yml file for your project:Run the application using Docker Compose:Differences Between Containers and Virtual MachinesContainers: Share the host OS kernel, lightweight, and start almost instantly.Virtual Machines (VMs): Each VM includes a full OS, apps, binaries, and libraries, making them heavier and slower to start.Benefits of DockerConsistency: By packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, Docker ensures that the software behaves the same in any environment, reducing “it works on my machine” issues.Efficiency: Containers are more resource-efficient than traditional VMs because they share the host OS kernel and avoid the overhead of running a full OS.Portability : Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, including local machines, on-premises servers, and cloud environments.Scalability: Docker simplifies scaling applications up or down by allowing quick deployment of additional containers or removing them as needed.Isolation: Each Docker container runs in isolation, providing security benefits by limiting the potential impact of a compromised application.ConclusionDocker simplifies the development and deployment process by providing consistent environments and efficient resource usage. By following this hands-on guide, you’ve set up a simple Docker project, created a Dockerfile, built an image, and run a container. For more detailed information, refer to the official Docker documentation.This practical guide gives you a hands-on approach to using Docker, from installation to running a simple Python application in a container.
