## AI-Powered Upskilling Chatbot

### Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to assist users in skill development across various domains. The system uses a multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents to manage personalized learning paths, profile building, and content discovery from both **internal** and **external** resources.

The chatbot leverages **Azure** tools such as **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **File Search**, and **Bing Search** to provide users with relevant educational content. **Confluence** serves as the internal knowledge base, offering curated learning materials. With this, the chatbot creates a dynamic learning experience by combining internal and external sources to offer tailored educational journeys.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Functionality
The chatbot operates through several specialized agents, ensuring an efficient and personalized learning process:

#### **Profile Collection**
- **Profile Builder Agent**: Collects user information to build a personalized learning profile, which serves as the foundation for the learning path.

#### **Learning Path Generation**
- **Learning Path Agent**: Generates customized curricula based on the user's profile and adapts the learning journey as the user progresses.

#### **Knowledge Retrieval**
- **Confluence Agent**: Accesses GD Academy's internal knowledge base, providing users with detailed content on various topics.
- **Bing Search Agent**: Searches external resources like online courses, tutorials, and articles to enhance the learning experience with the latest external knowledge.

#### **Orchestration**
- **Semantic Kernel Agent**: Orchestrates the process by managing the flow of information between the agents, ensuring that user queries are routed to the appropriate agent for the best possible response.
