# Use Case: Emily’s Journey with the GD Academy Chatbot System

## Background
Emily had just joined Gnomon Digital, a fast-paced AI and data-driven tech startup, as the new Marketing Manager. With years of experience in branding and storytelling, she was confident in her ability to shape the company’s image — but there was one challenge.

Her colleagues spoke fluently in acronyms like RAG, LLM Ops, and K8s clusters. In meetings, technical terms flew by, and she found herself hesitating to contribute. She knew she didn’t need to become an engineer, but she needed to understand enough to ask smart questions and speak the team's language with confidence.

That’s when a colleague pointed her to GD Academy — an internal platform designed to help everyone at Gnomon Digital strengthen their knowledge in AI, data, and cloud. It was powered by a multi-agent chatbot system built for guided, personalized learning.

### Step 1: First Contact – The Chat Agent
Emily logs into GD Academy, and the Chat Agent welcomes her:

“Hello Emily! Welcome to GD Academy — your space to grow confident in AI, Data, and Cloud. I can help you explore the platform or connect you with an agent who can build your learning journey. Would you like to start by creating your profile for a personalized path?”

Feeling encouraged, Emily replies, “Yes, please,” and is seamlessly handed off.

### Step 2: Getting to Know Emily – The Profile Builder Agent
The Profile Builder Agent takes over with a friendly message:

“Great! Let’s build your learning profile. This helps us tailor your experience and recommend the most relevant resources. You can update it anytime — we’re here to support you every step of the way.”

Emily answers 10 multiple-choice questions, sharing that:

She works in marketing with over 8 years of experience.  

Her goal is to understand key AI and data concepts to better collaborate with technical teams.  

She considers herself a beginner in tech.  

She prefers clear explanations in plain language, ideally with real-world examples.  

She has 3–4 hours per week to dedicate to learning.

With her profile complete, she’s handed off to the next agent.

### Step 3: Her Personal Curriculum – The Learning Path Agent
The Learning Path Agent greets her:

“Thanks, Emily! Based on your background and goals, here’s your personalized learning path:

Level 1 – Foundations: What is AI? What is Cloud Computing?  

Level 2 – Meet the Tech Team Halfway: APIs, Data Pipelines, AI Use Cases in Marketing  

Level 3 – Confident Conversations: RAG, LLMs, Prompt Engineering Basics  

Each level includes an assessment to track your progress and adapt your journey based on your feedback.”

Emily breathes a sigh of relief — for the first time, this all feels manageable.

### Step 4: Deep Dives – The Confluence Agent
While exploring Level 2, Emily gets curious: "Are there any internal examples of AI-powered MarTech in action?"

The Confluence Agent responds:

“I don't see specific documentation on that in our Confluence knowledge base. Would you like me to search for external resources using the Bing Search Agent?”

Emily replied “Yes“.

### Step 5: Extra Curiosity – The Bing Search Agent
The Bing Search Agent steps in:

“Here are 3 curated resources on AI in MarTech:

The top 50 genAI use cases in marketing

Examining 6 AI Use Cases for Marketing Technology

Leveraging AI to Solve Top 10 MarTech Use Cases

Would you like a summary of any of these?”

Result: From Hesitant to Empowered
Within a month, Emily:

Confidently contributed to a product roadmap session by suggesting AI-driven user segmentation.  

Created a marketing brief using accurate technical language.  

Shared her AI learning journey on LinkedIn, reaching and inspiring other non-technical professionals beyond her company to start learning too.

She didn’t become a data scientist — and she didn’t need to. She gained the confidence, vocabulary, and context to excel in her role and build deeper connections with her team.

Emily’s Feedback
“GD Academy didn’t just throw content at me — it understood me. I felt seen, guided, and supported. This is how every onboarding should be in a tech-driven company.”
